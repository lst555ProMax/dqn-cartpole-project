# Output files from your scripts (if they are generated and not source)
# For example, if your dqn_test*.txt files are purely dqn_output and can be regenerated
# you might consider ignoring them. However, if they contain important experimental
# results you want to track, then DO NOT ignore them.
# Based on your project, your .txt files seem to be results,
# so I will NOT add them to .gitignore by default.
# If you decide to ignore them, uncomment the line below:
# *.txt
